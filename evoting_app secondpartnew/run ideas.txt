Step-by-Step Project Execution Explanation


Step 1: Open VS Code

VS Code is used as the main development environment.

We manage:

Flutter frontend code

PHP backend API

Node.js proxy server

Python face recognition script

📌 Why:
It allows editing, debugging, and running all project components from one place.

Step 2: Start XAMPP Server

Open XAMPP Control Panel

Start:

Apache → for PHP backend APIs

MySQL → for storing voter data and face embeddings

📌 Why:
The PHP backend and database must be running to:

Store voter details

Store face embeddings

Verify users during voting


Step 3: Run Ganache (Blockchain Local Server)

Open Command Prompt or Ganache GUI

Start Ganache (local Ethereum blockchain)

Ganache provides:

Local blockchain network

Test accounts

Private keys

Wallet balances

📌 Why:
Ganache simulates the Ethereum blockchain locally, allowing us to:

Deploy smart contracts

Store votes securely

Test transactions without real Ether


Step 4: Run Node.js Proxy Server

Open terminal in the proxy folder

Run:

node proxy.js

📌 Why:

Flutter cannot directly communicate with blockchain RPC due to CORS issues

Node.js proxy:

Acts as a bridge between Flutter and blockchain

Forwards requests safely to Ganache


Step 5: Open Remix IDE and Compile Smart Contract

Open Remix IDE (v1.3.0)

Load voting.sol

Compile the smart contract

📌 Why:
Compilation checks:

Syntax correctness

Smart contract logic

Security rules


Step 6: Deploy Smart Contract

Select Injected Web3 / Ganache provider

Deploy the contract

Copy:

Contract Address

ABI

📌 Why:

Contract address identifies the deployed voting contract

ABI allows Flutter to interact with smart contract functions


Step 7: Configure Flutter with Blockchain Details

Paste into Flutter:

Smart contract address

ABI

Ganache private key

📌 Why:

Private key signs blockchain transactions

Flutter app uses this to:

Cast votes

Read vote counts

Interact securely with smart contract

Step 8: Run Flutter Application

Run Flutter using:

flutter run

📌 Why:
This launches the mobile voting app where:

Users register

Face verification is done

Votes are cast on blockchain

Results are viewed transparently

One-Line Flow Summary (Viva Gold Answer)

“First we start XAMPP for backend and database, then Ganache for blockchain simulation. 
We deploy the voting smart contract using Remix, configure its address and private key 
in Flutter, run a Node.js proxy for secure blockchain communication, and finally
run the Flutter app for secure face-verified blockchain voting.”
